Churn Prediction Model for Cab Drivers:

Overview:

Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for multiple cab organizations. Churn among drivers is high and it’s very easy for driversto stop working for the service on the fly or jump to other cab serrvices depending on the rates. 
As the companies get bigger, the high churn could become abigger problem. To find new drivers, cab organizations are casting a wide net, including people who don’t have cars for jobs. But this acquisition is really costly.Losing drivers frequently impacts the morale of the organization and acquiring new drivers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

Problem Statement:

1.Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis to understand what factors are affecting in churning.
2.Build a Bagging/Boosting model which can classify whether driver will churn or stay.
3.Check model performance using below metric: ROC AUC,Precision,Recall,F1 Score
4.Find the features which are important in classifying the churning.
5.Provide actionable insights and recommendations which organization can follow during recruitment of drivers.

Results Achieved:

Developed a predictive model to identify cab drivers who are likely to churn using different ensemble model such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBOOST.
Conducted feature importance analysis and compared the performance of individual models using metrics like Precision, Recall and F1-Score to identify the best model .
